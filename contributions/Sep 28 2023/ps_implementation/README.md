# ps command
The `ps` command has been written in the `user/ps.c` file. The `parse_cmd()` function parses the `ps` command to extract the potential options of `pid`, `ppid`, `stat`, and `name`.
In this version, only specific statuses deemed worthy of printing have been selected for implementation.
