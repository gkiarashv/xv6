A Ruby script that colorizes the `ls` output with color and icons. Here are the screenshots of working example on an iTerm2 terminal (Mac OS), `oh-my-zsh` with `powerlevel9k` theme and `powerline nerd-font + awesome-config` font with the `Solarized Dark` color theme.

# Installation

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. Install Ruby (preferably, version >= 2.6)
2. [Download](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) and install a Nerd Font. Have a look at the [Nerd Font README](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/readme.md) for installation instructions.

    *Note for `iTerm2` users - Please enable the Nerd Font at iTerm2 > Preferences > Profiles > Text > Non-ASCII font > Hack Regular Nerd Font Complete.*

    *Note for `HyperJS` users - Please add `"Hack Nerd Font"` Font as an option to `fontFamily` in your `~/.hyper.js` file.*

3. Install the [colorls](https://rubygems.org/gems/colorls/) ruby gem with `gem install colorls`

    *Note for `rbenv` users - In case of load error when using `lc`, please try the below patch.*

    ```sh
    rbenv rehash
    rehash
    ```

4. Enable tab completion for flags by entering following line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) :
    ```bash
    source $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/tab_complete.sh
    ```

5. Start using `colorls` :tada:

6. Have a look at [Recommended configurations](#recommended-configurations) and [Custom configurations](#custom-configurations).

# Recommended configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

1. To add some short command (say, `lc`) with some flag options (say, `-l`, `-A`, `--sd`) by default, add this to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) :
    ```sh
    alias lc='colorls -lA --sd'
    ```

2. For changing the icon(s) to other unicode icons of choice (select icons from [here](https://nerdfonts.com/)), change the YAML files in a text editor of your choice (say, `subl`)

    ```sh
    subl $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml
    ```

# Custom configurations

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You can overwrite the existing icons and colors mapping by copying the yaml files from `$(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml` into `~/.config/colorls`, and changing them.

- To overwrite color mapping :

  Please have a look at the [list of supported color names](https://github.com/sickill/rainbow#color-list). You may also use a color hex code as long as it is quoted within the YAML file and prefaced with a `#` symbol.

  Let's say that you're using the dark color scheme and would like to change the color of untracked file (`??`) in the `--git-status` flag to yellow. Copy the defaut `dark_colors.yaml` and change it.

  ```sh
  cp $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml/dark_colors.yaml ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml
  ```

  In the `~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml` file, change the color set for `untracked` from `darkorange` to `yellow`, and save the change.

  ```
  untracked: yellow
  ```

  Or, using hex color codes:

  ```
  untracked: '#FFFF00'
  ```

- To overwrite icon mapping :

  Please have a look at the [list of supported icons](https://nerdfonts.com/). Let's say you want to add an icon for swift files. Copy the default `files.yaml` and change it.

  ```sh
  cp $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/yaml/files.yaml ~/.config/colorls/files.yaml`
  ```

  In the `~/.config/colorls/files.yaml` file, add a new icon / change an existing icon, and save the change.


  ```
  swift: "\uF179"
  ```

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)).  See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/, which provides
pointers to on-line resources for v6.

ERROR REPORTS

Please send errors and suggestions to Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris
(kaashoek,rtm@mit.edu).  The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching
operating system for MIT's 6.1810, so we are more interested in
simplifications and clarifications than new features.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

You will need a RISC-V "newlib" tool chain from
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain, and qemu compiled for
riscv64-softmmu.  Once they are installed, and in your shell
search path, you can run "make qemu".
